Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software that runs for the whole month of October.
Today is officially the second day of Hacktoberfest, over 7,000 issues were closed, a  bunch of new issues are raised every day. Needless to say, that October is possibly one of the busiest months in the open source community.

By participating in the Hacktoberfest you get stickers and if you submit four pull requests on GitHub you will win a limited edition shirt as well.

This is my first year participating in Hacktoberfest, the biggest problem I've come across is to decide which project to help and find enough time to it. It's not unusual to have someone beat you and get their pull request accepted. This definitely makes you want to work all day and night to try and solve a particular issue as fast as possible.

## What I've learned
----
&nbsp;


The biggest thing I've learned so far is how to use `git rebase` and `squash` properly. On one of the projects, the maintainer asked me to rebase my commits and squash them together into one.

Since I've never had done something like that before, so I had to do a bit of reading and a bit of test-fail-test. In the end, I managed to rebase and squash my commits into one.

There is also a huge number of projects that need help with creating tests so I've decided to study a bit more about creating good test cases so I could help projects in the future.

I will update this post as long as Hacktoberfest is running. Hopefully, I'll learn many more things and have the opportunity to work on many more projects (who knows I might just win a shirt!)
