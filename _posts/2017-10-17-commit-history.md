If you are just starting using GitHub and contributing to Open Source you might come to a point in which you have a massive commit history. With each new contribution, commits and pushes will get recorded on your own fork. If your contibution gets accepted and a project maintainer merges your Pull Request into the main repo, your commits will still appear on your own fork.

If the project you are contributing to is a small project and most changes are made by one or two persons, chances are that you won't create any conflicts while subimiting a Pull Request, so you keep on going on this cycle until one day you wonder why the heck you have a bunch of commits on your history.

At this point you might google a way to keep your commits down and you will probably read about `git rebase`. You might even start rebasing your commits to keep them down and either you fix the issue or everything seems to be messed up as you touched other contributors commits as well.

I was sitting on a 44 commit history, wondering why the hell all my commits were showing every time I did a new Pull Request. But since only the last changes where being included on the Pull Request I kept on going. Eventually I learned how to fix this issue and why this was happening.
