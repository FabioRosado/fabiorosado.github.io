While listening to one episode of `Podcast.__init__` I came across Opsdroid. In the end of the show, Jacob Tomlinson says that he would love to have people helping with the project.  

I always wanted to contribute to an Open Source project but wasn't sure how to start. One day I checked Osdroid on GitHub, went through the list of issues, forked the repo and read some of the code to try and understand how everything worked.

Initially, I was unsure how to help. I doubted that I could do much with the knowledge I had. I even had to read about yaml files and what you do with them. In the end, I helped with documentation (mostly changing README and the example configuration file).

Jacob has been a pretty amazing person since the first day I've made my first pull request to Opsdroid and he is always ready to give a hand or a piece of advice. Not only I've grown a lot since I started contributing to the project I've also learned new things and ways to write better code.
